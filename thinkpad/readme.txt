These scripts are thinkpad specific and keybindings source directly to this directory
(assuming the dotfiles dir is in your XDG home.)
If you want the WM but don't care about rotating your screen or changing your volume
with hardware buttons you can safely delete this dir and everything under [Thinkpad] in sxxhkd.
