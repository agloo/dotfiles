These scripts use the output of a numeric VU meter and dynamically change the window border size based on it.
It's fresh as hell, but it varies wildly depending on what audio server you're using.
I use one from here:

But you can feel free to use whatever program you'd like. If you put it in this directory under the name VUmeter (or just edit pulse.sh to use it.)
